### Python Challenges
* Pick a Python command-line tool library you are not familar with and build a module with a function that is called in a CLI.  A few examples:  
  * [python-fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire), 
  * [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
  * [python-click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)
* Write a test for your python CLI tool
* Containerize your Python CLI tool and deploy to a public container repo like [Github Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) or [Amazon Public Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ecr-public-a-new-public-container-registry/).  Here is an [example project](https://github.com/noahgift/container-from-scratch-python).
